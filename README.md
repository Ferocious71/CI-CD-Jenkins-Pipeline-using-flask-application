GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow
This repository contains a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask application. The workflow includes:

Automated Testing: Runs on every push or pull request to main or staging.
Building the Application: Runs after tests pass.
Deploying to Staging: Triggers when changes are pushed to staging.
Deploying to Production: Triggers when a new GitHub Release is published.
How to Set Up
Fork the repository and clone it locally.
Create main and staging branches.
Add necessary secrets under GitHub repository settings.
Push changes to trigger the pipeline.
Triggering Deployment
Staging: Push to staging branch.
Production: Create a GitHub Release.
5. Submission Checklist
âœ… GitHub Repository: Include the link to your repository with workflow files.
âœ… Updated README.md: Explains the pipeline steps and secret configurations.
âœ… Screenshots of Workflow Runs: Capture successful workflow execution from GitHub Actions tab.

I have forked a repository on github and  i have requirement.txt already in the main branch which has all the installations to install but do I need to add python to install or it is done through the yaml file
ChatGPT said:
You donâ€™t need to explicitly install Python manually because the YAML workflow file already includes a step that sets up Python using the actions/setup-python GitHub Action. This step ensures that the required Python version is installed in the GitHub Actions runner.

Key Section in Your YAML File
yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: "3.9"
This automatically installs Python 3.9 (or the specified version) on the runner.

How Dependencies Are Installed
Since you already have a requirements.txt file in your repository, the following step in your YAML workflow takes care of installing dependencies:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
This:

Creates a virtual environment (venv).
Activates the virtual environment.
Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt.
Conclusion
No need to manually install Python. The YAML file ensures Python is available in the runner before installing dependencies. Just make sure requirements.txt includes all necessary packages for your Flask app. ðŸš€
